            <li>12 oz. hot Italian sausage, casings discarded, shaped into ½” balls</li>
            <li>1 small red onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 jalapeño, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt </li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 c. BBQ sauce</li>
            <li>1 (8-oz.) block cream cheese, cubed</li>
            <li>3/4 c. freshly shredded American cheese</li>
            <li>3/4 c. freshly shredded cheddar </li>
            <li>1/4 c. pickled red onions, finely chopped, plus more for topping</li>
            <li>1/4 c. whole milk</li>
            <li>1 scallion, thinly sliced, for topping

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium skillet over medium heat, cook sausage until deeply golden, shaking the skillet occasionally, 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer meatballs to a plate and keep 2 tablespoons fat in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Return skillet to medium-high heat and stir in onions, jalapeño, garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until golden and lightly caramelized, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low. Add BBQ sauce, cooked meatballs, and cream cheese and stir until smooth. Remove from heat and stir in shredded cheeses, pickled red onions, and milk until melty and incorporated. </li>
            <li>Garnish with scallions and more pickled red onions before serving warm with tortilla chips.</li>
